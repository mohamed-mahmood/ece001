	<p class=" text2" > was created in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf and means Personal Home Page language. Ever since its beginning it has been one of the most intuitive programming languages used for the creation of dynamic web pages. Later, when the PHP team was formed, the parser was rewritten and PHP version 3.0 saw the light of day. The PHP 3 version was the first serious improvement of the PHP language, which fixed a lot of bugs and completely redesigned the PHP core. The meaning of the abbreviation was also changed to PHP Hypertext Preprocessor</p>

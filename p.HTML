		<h1>Some language versions:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>PHP4
				<p>The launch of PHP4 marked serious progress in the usage of the programming language. This is the first version powered by the Zend Engine, which allows working with encoded files through the Zend Optimizer</p></li>
			<li>PHP5
				<p>The latest, so far, version 5 introduced a completely reworked, advanced object-oriented programming support, as well as many improvements towards better productivity and security. PHP 5 is an attempt to break from the PHP 3 era, while still offering almost complete backwards compatibility. Unfortunately, this PHP version still does not offer native support for Unicode or multibyte strings</p>
			</li>
			<li>PHP with NTC hosting
				<p>NTC Hosting offers its clients an ultimate PHP hosting solution with the possibility to choose the older, but proven PHP4, or to easily upgrade to the newer PHP5.</p>
			</li>
